I am Selin Pir. I am a first year Management Information Systems student. I want to try everything I can in my software journey. I will be sharing with you the knowledge I have gained and the projects I have created on this journey. One of the areas I want to work in is Artificial Intelligence and I hope I can give a product to the service of humanity. Apart from that, while developing myself in the field of Back End, I am also examining the front end field by relying on my design skills.
