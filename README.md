It may seem like I'm doing nothing but struggling, and it's obvious that I need optimization — just like systems do.

Hi, I’m Selin. A 3rd-year Management Information Systems student — well, technically 4th year now since there are only 3 weeks left to the semester.  
So I believe it’s fair to say I’ve earned my spot in that glorious *senior internship quota*.

I love writing code, working with data, and analyzing it.  
I’m actively trying to improve myself in **Data Science**, but unfortunately, I haven’t been able to find an internship in this field yet.

While I may not have mastered every tool or language taught at school, I’m confident in my ability to learn deeply and quickly when I’m given the chance to actually work with them.

## 🧰 Technologies & Tools
- **Programming Languages:** C, C#, Python  
- **Web Development:** Django, HTML, CSS(feel like the eggs of web development: even if you can't cook, you can at least cook eggs.)
- **Databases:** MySQL  
- **Data Science & Simulation Tools:** Orange, ARENA  
- **Office & Scripting:** Excel (woo!), VBA

Like most of my peers, I use AI to write most of my code —  
but I make sure to understand the logic and structure behind what I build.
